# adrift â€“ Modelling drift on admixture graphs

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/mailund/adrift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mailund/adrift)

The goal of `adrift` is to have an improved `admixturegraph` package
with better visualisation of graphs and graph statistics.

## Installation

You can install the released version of adrift from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("adrift")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mailund/adrift")
```

## Example

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(tidygraph)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'tidygraph'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter
library(ggraph)
library(matchbox)
library(adrift)
#> Loading required package: dplyr
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':
#> 
#>     vars
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
#> Loading required package: pmatch
#> Loading required package: tailr
#> Loading required package: minilexer
#> Loading required package: Rcpp
